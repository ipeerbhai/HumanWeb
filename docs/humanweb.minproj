					"Message": "Creating a conda environment with a specific version of Python, such as Python 3.11.7, is relatively straightforward. Here's how you can create a conda environment named \"blender\" with Python 3.11.7:\n\n1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**\n\n2. **Use the following command to create the conda environment:**\n\n   ```\n   conda create --name blender python=3.11.7\n   ```\n\n3. **Press `y` when prompted to proceed with the package plan. Conda will take a moment to resolve and download the appropriate packages.**\n\n4. **After the environment is created, you can activate it using:**\n\n   ```\n   conda activate blender\n   ```\n\nNow, you have a conda environment named \"blender\" with Python 3.11.7 installed. You can install additional packages specific to Blender or other dependencies you may need for your projects.\n\n### Example Step-by-Step:\n\n1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**\n   - On Windows: You can open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.\n   - On macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal.\n\n2. **Create the environment:**\n\n   ```\n   conda create --name blender python=3.11.7\n   ```\n\n   Output should look something like this:\n   ```\n   Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done\n   Solving environment: done\n\n   ## Package Plan ##\n\n     environment location: /path/to/your/miniconda3/envs/blender\n\n     added / updated specs:\n       - python=3.11.7\n\n   The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n\n     ca-certificates    pkgs/main/osx-64::ca-certificates-2021.10.26-hecd8cb5_2\n     openssl            pkgs/main/osx-64::openssl-1.1.1l-h9ed2024_0\n     pip                pkgs/main/osx-64::pip-21.2.2-py311hecd8cb5_0\n     python             pkgs/main/osx-64::python-3.11.7-hf930737_0\n     setuptools         pkgs/main/osx-64::setuptools-58.0.4-py311hecd8cb5_0\n     sqlite             pkgs/main/osx-64::sqlite-3.36.0-hce871da_0\n     tk                 pkgs/main/osx-64::tk-8.6.11-h0ce87d6_0\n     xvfbwrapper        pkgs/main/noarch::xvfbwrapper-0.2.9-pyhd3eb1b0_0\n     zlib               pkgs/main/osx-64::zlib-1.2.11-h4dc903c_4\n\n   Proceed ([y]/n)? y\n   ```\n\n3. **Activate the environment:**\n\n   ```\n   conda activate blender\n   ```\n\nNow the command line prompt should indicate that you're working within the \"blender\" environment.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **List all environments**: You can see all your conda environments with `conda env list`.\n\n- **Deactivate the environment**: Simply run `conda deactivate` to get out of the current environment.\n\n- **Remove an environment**: If you need to delete the environment, use `conda remove --name blender --all`.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a custom conda environment tailored for your needs with Python 3.11.7.",

					"Message": "No, Streamlit does not explicitly wait for user input to proceed. The script runs from top to bottom every time there's a change in the input, and it continuously updates the displayed content. If the user does not enter anything, the output for the section checking `if user_input:` will simply be omitted.\n\nTo handle situations where the user might not enter anything, you can modify the script to display a different message or prompt the user until they enter some text. Here is how you can do it:\n\n### Updated Example Script\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\n# Set the title of the app\nst.title('Welcome to My Streamlit App!')\n\n# Create a text input widget\nuser_input = st.text_input('Enter your name:')\n\n# Check if the user has entered any text\nif user_input:\n    # Display the greeting message\n    st.write(f'Hello, {user_input}!')\nelse:\n    # Prompt the user to enter some text\n    st.write('Please enter your name above to receive a greeting')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `else: st.write('Please enter your name above to receive a greeting')`: This part of the code ensures that a message is displayed when the text input is empty, prompting the user to enter their name.\n\n### Screenshot of the App\n\nHere's what the app will look like if the user hasn't entered anything:\n\n```\n----------------------------------------\n| Welcome to My Streamlit App!         |\n----------------------------------------\n| Enter your name: [             ]     |\n----------------------------------------\n| Please enter your name above to      |\n| receive a greeting                   |\n----------------------------------------\n```\n\nAnd after the user enters their name and hits Enter:\n\n```\n----------------------------------------\n| Welcome to My Streamlit App!         |\n----------------------------------------\n| Enter your name: [John Doe     ]     |\n| Hello, John Doe!                     |\n----------------------------------------\n```\n\nIn summary, Streamlit does not wait for user input per se; it just continuously updates the script output based on the current inputs. By handling the case where no input is provided, you can ensure the app gives clear feedback to the user.",

					"Message": "The warning messages you're seeing indicate that the Streamlit code is being run in a way that doesn't create a proper ScriptRunContext, which is necessary for Streamlit to manage the session state and renders. This typically happens when you run a Streamlit script using a method other than `streamlit run`.\n\n### Solutions\n\n#### 1. Run Using `streamlit run`\n\nTo properly run a Streamlit app, ensure you use the `streamlit run` command from the terminal or command prompt. This sets up the necessary context for Streamlit to manage the app lifecycle.\n\n1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**\n\n2. **Navigate to the directory where your Streamlit script (`test.py`) is located:**\n\n   ```bash\n   cd C:\\github\\HumanWeb\\src\\UI\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Streamlit app using the `streamlit run` command:**\n\n   ```bash\n   streamlit run test.py\n   ```\n\nThis command will start a local web server and provide a URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`) where you can view your Streamlit app in a web browser.\n\n#### 2. Check for Incorrect Script Execution\n\nMake sure you are not running your script directly through an IDE's \"Run\" button, or using `python test.py`, as this method won't set up the Streamlit context properly.\n\n### Example Output\n\nAfter running the correct command, you should see something like this in your terminal:\n\n```bash\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\n\n  Local URL: http://localhost:8501\n  Network URL: http://[your network IP]:8501\n```\n\nNavigate to the provided URL in your web browser to view your app.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Virtual Environment/Conda Environment Activation**: Ensure you activate the appropriate environment before running the Streamlit command if you are using a virtual environment or conda environment.\n  \n  ```bash\n  conda activate blender\n  streamlit run test.py\n  ```\n\n- **Dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies are installed in your environment. If you included `streamlit` in your `requirements.txt`, make sure you ran the installation with:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\n  ```\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that your Streamlit script runs with the correct context, and you'll be able to view and interact with your app through a web browser.",

					"Message": "Certainly! I'll analyze the test code you've provided and summarize the key concepts without writing any code. Here's a summary of the main concepts and components in your test code:\n\n1. Browser Automation: The code uses a custom BrowserClient class to interact with a web browser, likely using Selenium WebDriver under the hood.\n\n2. RESTful API Interaction: The BrowserClient communicates with a FastAPI-based server running on localhost:8676, sending HTTP requests to various endpoints.\n\n3. Session Management: The client maintains a session using a unique identifier (UID) to keep track of browser instances.\n\n4. Navigation: The client can navigate to web pages using the 'navigate' method.\n\n5. Content Retrieval: Methods are available to get both raw source code and human-readable content from web pages.\n\n6. Web Element Interaction: The 'find_and_do_action' method allows for interacting with specific elements on a web page, such as clicking buttons or filling in text fields.\n\n7. Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for failed requests or actions.\n\n8. Asynchronous Operations: The code uses time.sleep() to wait for page loads, suggesting asynchronous operations.\n\n9. Example Usage: The code includes an example of navigating to LinkedIn, retrieving page content, and interacting with the sign-in button.\n\nThis setup appears to be designed for web scraping, automated testing, or general web automation tasks. It provides a high-level interface to control a web browser programmatically, which could be useful for various applications involving web interaction.",

					"Message": "Absolutely! That's a great idea to enhance the interactivity of your DSL. Adding a capability to prompt the user and wait for their response is definitely possible with Streamlit, and it can significantly improve the flexibility of your automation scripts.\n\nHere's how we could approach this:\n\n1. Modal Dialog: Streamlit doesn't have a built-in modal dialog, but we can simulate one using Streamlit's components. We could use a combination of `st.empty()` and `st.container()` to create a section that appears like a modal dialog.\n\n2. User Prompt: We can display the prompt text in this \"modal\" area, explaining what action the user needs to take.\n\n3. Confirmation Button: We'll add a button that the user can click when they've completed the requested action.\n\n4. Blocking Execution: While waiting for the user's confirmation, we'll pause the execution of the script. This ensures that subsequent commands don't run until the user has completed their task.\n\n5. New DSL Command: We can introduce a new command in our DSL, something like `ASK_USER \"Your prompt text here\"`, which will trigger this modal prompt.\n\nThe flow would look something like this:\n1. The DSL encounters an `ASK_USER` command.\n2. The script execution pauses, and a \"modal\" appears with the specified prompt.\n3. The user performs the requested action (like logging in to LinkedIn).\n4. Once done, the user clicks a \"Confirm\" button in the \"modal\".\n5. The \"modal\" disappears, and the script continues executing the next commands.\n\nThis approach allows for human intervention at specific points in your automation script, which can be crucial for tasks that require manual input or verification.\n\nDoes this align with what you had in mind?

When an `ASK_USER` command is encountered, it creates a temporary container with the prompt and a \"Confirm\" button.\n4. The script execution pauses until the user clicks the \"Confirm\" button.\n5. After confirmation, the temporary container is removed, and the script continues.\n\nThis implementation simulates a modal dialog using Streamlit's components. When you run this script, you'll be able to include `ASK_USER` commands in your DSL script, and the execution will pause at those points, waiting for user confirmation before proceeding.",

					"Message": "I apologize for the confusion. The `st.experimental_rerun()` function has been deprecated in newer versions of Streamlit. Let's update the code to use the current recommended method. Instead of using `st.experimental_rerun()`, we can use `st.rerun()`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of that part of the code:\n\n```python\n# Add new command input\nnew_command = st.text_input(\"Add new command\")\nif st.button(\"Add Command\"):\n    st.session_state.script += f\"\\n{new_command}\"\n    st.rerun()\n```\n\nThis change should resolve the AttributeError you encountered. The `st.rerun()` function will cause the Streamlit app to re-run, which will update the script with the newly added command.\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention.

					"Message": "Certainly! That's a great idea to improve the user experience and reduce errors when adding new commands. We can implement this using Streamlit's selectbox for the command selection and dynamic input fields based on the selected command. Here's how we can modify the script to achieve this:\n\n1. First, we'll define a dictionary that maps each DSL command to its required arguments.\n2. We'll use a selectbox for command selection.\n3. Based on the selected command, we'll dynamically display the appropriate input fields.\n4. When the user fills in the fields and clicks \"Add Command\", we'll construct the full command and add it to the script.\n\nHere's how you could modify the relevant part of the script:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # ... (previous code remains the same)\n\n    # Define command structure\n    command_structure = {\n        \"NAVIGATE\": [\"URL\"],\n        \"ASK_USER\": [\"Prompt\"],\n        \"CLICK_XPATH\": [\"XPath\"],\n        \"TYPE_XPATH\": [\"XPath\", \"Text\"],\n        \"SAVE_TO_VARIABLE\": [\"Variable Name\", \"Value\"],\n        \"READ_XPATH\": [\"XPath\"],\n    }\n\n    # Command addition section\n    st.subheader(\"Add New Command\")\n    selected_command = st.selectbox(\"Select Command\", list(command_structure.keys()))\n    \n    # Dynamic input fields based on selected command\n    input_values = {}\n    for arg in command_structure[selected_command]:\n        input_values[arg] = st.text_input(f\"Enter {arg}\")\n\n    if st.button(\"Add Command\"):\n        if selected_command == \"TYPE_XPATH\":\n            new_command = f'{selected_command} \"{input_values[\"XPath\"]}\" \"{input_values[\"Text\"]}\"'\n        elif selected_command == \"SAVE_TO_VARIABLE\":\n            new_command = f'{selected_command} {input_values[\"Variable Name\"]} {input_values[\"Value\"]}'\n        else:\n            new_command = f'{selected_command} \"{input_values[command_structure[selected_command][0]]}\"'\n        \n        st.session_state.script += f\"\\n{new_command}\"\n        st.rerun()\n\n    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```\n\nThis modification does the following:\n\n1. Defines a `command_structure` dictionary that specifies the arguments required for each DSL command.\n2. Uses `st.selectbox` to let the user choose a command from a dropdown.\n3. Dynamically creates input fields based on the selected command's required arguments.\n4. When \"Add Command\" is clicked, it constructs the command string based on the selected command and input values.\n5. Adds the new command to the script and reruns the app to show the updated script.\n\nThis approach provides a more guided and error-resistant way for users to add new commands to the DSL script. It ensures that all necessary arguments are provided and helps maintain the correct syntax for each command type.\n\nWould you like me to incorporate this change into the full script, or do you want to discuss any aspects of this modification further?",

					"Message": "I apologize for the oversight. The error is occurring because of an extra backslash being added to the URL. This is likely happening when we construct the command string. Let's modify the command construction to prevent this issue. We'll use the `json` module to properly escape the URL string.\n\nHere's the updated part of the code that constructs the new command:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n\nif st.button(\"Add Command\"):\n    if selected_command == \"TYPE_XPATH\":\n        new_command = f'{selected_command} {json.dumps(input_values[\"XPath\"])} {json.dumps(input_values[\"Text\"])}'\n    elif selected_command == \"SAVE_TO_VARIABLE\":\n        new_command = f'{selected_command} {input_values[\"Variable Name\"]} {json.dumps(input_values[\"Value\"])}'\n    else:\n        new_command = f'{selected_command} {json.dumps(input_values[command_structure[selected_command][0]])}'\n    \n    st.session_state.script += f\"\\n{new_command}\"\n    st.rerun()\n```\n\nThis change uses `json.dumps()` to properly escape the strings, which should prevent the issue with backslashes in URLs.\n\nAlso, let's modify the `navigate` method in the `WebAutomationDSL` class to handle potential JSON-encoded URLs:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass WebAutomationDSL:\n    # ... (other methods remain the same)\n\n    def navigate(self, url):\n        try:\n            # Try to decode the URL in case it's JSON-encoded\n            url = json.loads(url)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            # If it's not JSON-encoded, use it as is\n            pass\n        \n        endpoint = f\"{BASE_URL}/v1/connectors/browser/navigate/\"\n        payload = {\"url\": url, \"uid\": self.uid if self.uid else \"default\"}\n        response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload)\n        if response.status_code == 200:\n            self.uid = payload[\"uid\"]\n            return f\"Navigated to {url}\"\n        else:\n            return f\"Navigation failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\"\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue with malformed URLs. The `json.dumps()` function will properly escape any special characters in the URL, and the modified `navigate` method will handle both JSON-encoded and plain URLs.\n\nPlease try these modifications and let me know if you're still experiencing any issues with adding or executing navigation commands.",

Proper construction of new commands using json.dumps() to handle special characters.\n7. Modified navigate method to handle both JSON-encoded and plain URLs.\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Ensure you have Streamlit and the required libraries installed.\n2. Make sure your BrowserClient service is running on the specified BASE_URL.\n3. Run this script using `streamlit run script_name.py`.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly handle URLs with special characters and provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and executing web automation scripts using your custom DSL.",

I've added a \"Clear Script\" button next to the \"Execute Script\" button.\n2. The buttons are placed in two columns using `st.columns(2)`.\n3. When the \"Clear Script\" button is clicked, it sets the script to an empty string and reruns the app.\n\nThis addition allows users to easily clear the entire script if they want to start fresh. The rest of the functionality remains the same as in the previous version. Users can still add commands, execute the script, and interact with the web automation tasks as before.\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. Ensure you have Streamlit and the required libraries installed.\n2. Make sure your BrowserClient service is running on the specified BASE_URL.\n3. Run this script using `streamlit run script_name.py`.\n\nThis implementation now provides an easy way to clear the script in addition to all the previous functionalities.",

					"Message": "Certainly! I can help you add a clear button to erase the DSL script entirely. To implement this, we'll need to modify the main() function in your script. Here's how you can add the clear button:\n\n1. First, we'll add a new button next to the \"Execute Script\" button.\n2. When this button is clicked, it will clear the content of the script text area.\n3. We'll use Streamlit's column layout to place the buttons side by side.\n\nHere's the modified part of the main() function:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    st.title(\"Web Automation DSL\")\n\n    dsl = WebAutomationDSL()\n\n    # Initialize session state\n    if 'script' not in st.session_state:\n        st.session_state.script = \"\"\"\nNAVIGATE https://www.linkedin.com\nASK_USER \"Please log in to LinkedIn and click 'Confirm' when done.\"\nCLICK_XPATH \"//button[@aria-label='Search']\"\nTYPE_XPATH \"//input[@aria-label='Search']\" \"Langchain\"\nSAVE_TO_VARIABLE post_content READ_XPATH \"//div[@class='feed-shared-update-v2__description']\"\nCLICK_XPATH \"//button[@aria-label='Comment']\"\nSAVE_TO_VARIABLE generated_comment GENERATE_COMMENT $post_content\nTYPE_XPATH \"//div[@aria-label='Add a comment']\" \"$generated_comment\"\n\"\"\"\n\n    # Display and edit the script\n    st.session_state.script = st.text_area(\"DSL Script\", st.session_state.script, height=300)\n\n    # Create two columns for buttons\n    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)\n\n    # Execute button in the first column\n    with col1:\n        if st.button(\"Execute Script\"):\n            # ... (rest of the execution code remains the same)\n\n    # Clear button in the second column\n    with col2:\n        if st.button(\"Clear Script\"):\n            st.session_state.script = \"\"\n            st.rerun()\n\n    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)\n```\n\nThis modification does the following:\n\n1. We create two columns using `st.columns(2)`.\n2. The \"Execute Script\" button is placed in the first column.\n3. A new \"Clear Script\" button is added in the second column.\n4. When the \"Clear Script\" button is clicked, it sets `st.session_state.script` to an empty string and calls `st.rerun()` to refresh the page, which will show the empty script area.\n\nWith these changes, you'll have a \"Clear Script\" button next to the \"Execute Script\" button. When clicked, it will completely erase the content of the DSL script field. The page will refresh, showing an empty script area, ready for new input.",

Let's modify the script to address this issue.

(rest of the function remains the same)\n```\n\nHere's what changed and how it fixes the issue:\n\n1. We added two new session state variables:\n   - `current_line`: Keeps track of which line in the script we're currently executing.\n   - `waiting_for_user`: A flag to indicate if we're waiting for user confirmation.\n\n2. The script execution is now managed in a while loop that runs as long as there are lines to execute.\n\n3. When an \"ASK_USER\" command is encountered:\n   - If we're not already waiting for the user, we set the `waiting_for_user` flag and rerun the script.\n   - We display the prompt and a \"Confirm\" button.\n   - If the user clicks \"Confirm\", we reset the `waiting_for_user` flag, move to the next line, and rerun the script.\n   - We break out of the loop to stop execution until the user confirms.\n\n4. For other commands, we execute them and move to the next line.\n\n5. When the script completes, we reset the execution state.\n\nThis implementation ensures that when an \"ASK_USER\" step is encountered, the workflow pauses and waits for the user to click \"Confirm\" before proceeding to the next step. The script will continue from where it left off after the user confirmation.\n\nReplace the `main()` function in your script with this updated version, and it should resolve the issue with the \"ASK_USER\" command.",

The WebAutomationDSL class with methods for executing various commands.\n2. The main Streamlit interface with the script text area.\n3. The \"Execute Script\" button to run the DSL commands.\n4. The \"Clear Script\" button to erase the DSL script entirely.\n5. The command addition section for adding new commands to the script.\n6. The fix for the \"ASK_USER\" command, ensuring that the script pauses and waits for user confirmation before proceeding.\n\nThe main changes are in the `main()` function, where we've implemented a line-by-line execution system that properly handles the \"ASK_USER\" command. This ensures that when an \"ASK_USER\" step is encountered, the workflow pauses and waits for the user to click \"Confirm\" before moving to the next step.",

We use a single `execution_state` dictionary in the session state to keep track of the script execution, reducing the number of individual state variables.\n\n2. The script execution now happens within a single Streamlit run, updating the output in real-time using a placeholder.\n\n3. We've removed most of the `st.rerun()` calls, which were causing the frequent page reloads.\n\n4. The \"ASK_USER\" command now creates a dynamic button that appears only when needed, without forcing a page reload.\n\n5. The execution output is displayed in a text area below the script, updating in real-time as the script runs.\n\n6. Adding a new command no longer triggers a page reload.\n\nThese changes should result in a smoother user experience with fewer page reloads and a more responsive interface. The script execution will update the output in real-time, and user interactions (like confirming an \"ASK_USER\" prompt) will be more seamless.",

We've created an `add_command()` function that constructs the new command based on the selected command type and input values.\n3. We're now using `st.session_state` to store the input values between Streamlit reruns.\n4. The \"Add Command\" button is now a form submit button, which triggers the `add_command()` function immediately when clicked.\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue with the \"Add Command\" button. Now, when you click the button, it should immediately add the command to the script without requiring a second click.\n\nThe rest of the file remains the same. You can replace the entire `main()` function in your script with this updated version, and it should work as expected.",

The `WebAutomationDSL` class with all its methods for executing various commands.\n2. The updated `main()` function with improved script execution and user interaction handling.\n3. The new command addition section using Streamlit's `form` feature to ensure immediate command addition when the button is clicked.\n4. Proper handling of the \"ASK_USER\" command to pause execution and wait for user confirmation.\n5. The ability to clear the script and reset the execution state.\n\nThis version should provide a smoother user experience with the Web Automation DSL, allowing for easier script editing, command addition, and execution.",

I'd like to be able to use an XPath to select an element on the page, and assign the human-readable content of the found element to the variable.\n\nCan you help me figure that out?",

					"Message": "Certainly! I can help you add functionality to assign the human-readable content of an element found by XPath to a variable. We'll need to modify the WebAutomationDSL class and add a new method to the FastAPI server. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, let's add a new method to the FastAPI server (in the second code block you provided):\n\n```python\n@app.post(\"/v1/connectors/browser/read_xpath/\")\nasync def read_xpath(element_details: ElementActions):\n    browser = None\n    if element_details.uid in browsers:\n        browser = browsers[element_details.uid]\n    try:\n        element = browser.find_element(By.XPATH, element_details.Search)\n        text = element.text\n        return {\"text\": text}\n    except WebDriverException as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))\n```\n\n2. Now, let's modify the WebAutomationDSL class in the first code block to include a new method for reading XPath and assigning to a variable:\n\n```python\ndef read_xpath_to_variable(self, args):\n    if not self.uid:\n        return \"No active browser session. Navigate to a page first.\"\n    variable_name, xpath = args.split(' ', 1)\n    xpath = xpath.strip('\"')\n    endpoint = f\"{BASE_URL}/v1/connectors/browser/read_xpath/\"\n    payload = {\n        \"Search\": xpath,\n        \"By\": \"xpath\",\n        \"Action\": \"\",\n        \"uid\": self.uid\n    }\n    response = requests.post(endpoint, json=payload)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        text = response.json().get(\"text\", \"\")\n        self.variables[variable_name] = text\n        return f\"Assigned text from XPath '{xpath}' to variable '{variable_name}'\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Failed to read xpath: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\"\n```\n\n3. Update the `execute_command` method in the WebAutomationDSL class to include the new command:\n\n```python\ndef execute_command(self, command, args):\n    method = getattr(self, command.lower(), None)\n    if method:\n        return method(args)\n    elif command == \"READ_XPATH_TO_VARIABLE\":\n        return self.read_xpath_to_variable(args)\n    else:\n        return f\"Unknown command: {command}\"\n```\n\n4. Finally, update the command structure in the main function to include the new command:\n\n```python\ncommand_structure = {\n    \"NAVIGATE\": [\"URL\"],\n    \"ASK_USER\": [\"Prompt\"],\n    \"CLICK_XPATH\": [\"XPath\"],\n    \"TYPE_XPATH\": [\"XPath\", \"Text\"],\n    \"SAVE_TO_VARIABLE\": [\"Variable Name\", \"Value\"],\n    \"READ_XPATH\": [\"XPath\"],\n    \"READ_XPATH_TO_VARIABLE\": [\"Variable Name\", \"XPath\"],\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use the new command in your DSL script like this:\n\n```\nREAD_XPATH_TO_VARIABLE my_variable \"//div[@class='some-class']\"\n```\n\nThis will find the element using the provided XPath, extract its text content, and assign it to the variable named \"my_variable\". You can then use this variable in subsequent commands using the ${my_variable} syntax.\n\nThese changes allow you to select an element on the page using XPath and assign its human-readable content to a variable, which you can then use in your script.",

					"Message": "It looks like you're encountering an issue while trying to install the `dotenv` package. The error suggests there might be a problem with the package's setup or with your Python environment. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this:\n\n1. First, try updating pip:\n   ```\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. Instead of `dotenv`, try installing `python-dotenv`, which is the more commonly used package for handling .env files:\n   ```\n   pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n\n3. If that doesn't work, try installing with the `--use-pep517` flag as suggested in the error message:\n   ```\n   pip install python-dotenv --use-pep517\n   ```\n\n4. If you're still having issues, it might be related to your Python environment. You're using Anaconda, so try creating a new environment and installing the package there:\n   ```\n   conda create -n newenv python=3.8\n   conda activate newenv\n   pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n\n5. If none of the above work, you could try installing from the GitHub repository directly:\n   ```\n   pip install git+https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv.git\n   ```\n\n6. Lastly, make sure your setuptools is up to date:\n   ```\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\nIf you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, it might be helpful to provide more information about your Python version and operating system.",
