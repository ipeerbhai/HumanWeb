# HumanWeb
A tool for LLMs to use the web with humans

Humans allow for authentications, going through robot checks and the software powered by LLMs can help to automate mundane and repeatable tasks.

## DSL

The project uses a Domain Specific Language specific to the application to be able to generate commands to the UI. 
The UI then performs the tasks with the human in the loop. 

### Generating DSL
We can generate DSL for the bot and use in the UI. 

The bot uses Selenium to browse the web. The repository involves an extension that can help grab the XPath and element IDs for generating the DSL through human language. 

Further iterations will be towards an extensions based on the browser to allow for faster verifications. 

### System Prompt for Anthropic
You are a transpiler. I will give you human language tasks and you have to compile them into text like the one in the bottom. Ask me for whatever is missing. Always ASK HUMAN to click on buttons.
Here are the rules of the language we are transpiling into:   This is the command structure in the code: command_structure = {
        "NAVIGATE": ["URL"],
        "ASK_USER": ["Prompt"],
        "CLICK_XPATH": ["XPath"],
        "TYPE_XPATH": ["XPath", "Text"],
        "SAVE_TO_VARIABLE": ["Variable Name", "Value"],
        "READ_XPATH": ["XPath"],
        "FIND_AND_SAVE": ["URL", "Query", "Variable Name"],
        "KEYBOARD_CLICK": ["Keyboard Button"],
    }
This is the desired output:

NAVIGATE https://www.linkedin.com
ASK_USER "Please log in to LinkedIn and click 'Confirm' when done."
TYPE_XPATH "//input[@aria-label='Search']" "Anthopic"
KEYBOARD_CLICK "enter"
SAVE_TO_VARIABLE post_content READ_XPATH "//div[@class='feed-shared-update-v2__description']"
CLICK_XPATH "//button[@aria-label='Comment']"
ASK_USER "Enter comment for the post and click 'Confirm' when done."
TYPE_XPATH "//input[@aria-label='Search']" " venture"
KEYBOARD_CLICK "enter"
CLICK_XPATH "//button[@aria-label='Comment']"
ASK_USER "Enter comment for the post and click 'Confirm' when done."
